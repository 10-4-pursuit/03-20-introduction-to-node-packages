# Exercise 1: Introduction to Node Packages in React

## Objective
Learn how to integrate an external Node package into a React application by adding and configuring the `react-toastify` component.

## Setup

1. **Create an 'Exercises' Directory** (If not already done):
   - If you haven't already, create a main directory on your local machine to house all your exercises. You can do this using `mkdir Exercises`.

2. **Fork the Repository**:
   - Navigate to the GitHub repository for this exercise at `03-20-introduction-to-node-packages`.
   - Click on the 'Fork' button to create a fork of the repository.

3. **Clone Your Forked Repository**:
   - Open your terminal.
   - Navigate to your `Exercises` directory using `cd path/to/Exercises`.
   - Run `git clone <your-forked-repo-url>` to clone the repository to your machine.
   - This will create a new directory named `03-20-introduction-to-node-packages` under `Exercises`.

4. **Initial Setup**:
   - The repository already includes the skeleton code generated by Create React App.
   - Navigate to the exercise directory: `cd 03-20-introduction-to-node-packages`.
   - Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
   - Start the development server with `npm start`.

## Exercise Instructions

1. **Explore the Project Structure**:
   - Familiarize yourself with the structure of a React application created with Create React App.
   - Identify key files and directories, such as `src`, `public`, and `package.json`.

2. **Install `react-toastify`**:
   - Install the `react-toastify` package using `npm install react-toastify`.
   - Check out the [`react-toastify` documentation](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction) for more information.

3. **Integrate `react-toastify` into Your Application**:
   - Import `ToastContainer` and `toast` from `react-toastify` in `App.js`.
   - Add the `ToastContainer` component to your application's render method.
   - Create a button that, when clicked, uses the `toast` function to display a simple notification.

4. **Experiment and Explore**:
   - Experiment with different properties and configurations of the `react-toastify` component.
   - Adjust the position and appearance of the toast notifications.

## Bonus Challenge

- **Displaying Different Types of Toasts**:
   - Create multiple buttons in your application, each triggering a different type of toast notification.
   - Use various `toast` methods such as `toast.success`, `toast.error`, `toast.info`, and `toast.warning` to display notifications with different styles and icons.
   - For example, a button labeled "Success" should trigger `toast.success("Success message!")`, and similarly for other types.
   - Explore the [`react-toastify` API documentation](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/api/toast) to see examples of using different toast types. This section provides detailed information on how to utilize various toast methods to achieve different notification styles.
   - Experiment with the options available for each toast type to customize their appearance and behavior.

## Submission

1. **Commit Your Changes**:
   - After completing the exercise, ensure all your changes are saved.
   - Run `git add .` to stage your changes.
   - Run `git commit -m "Completed Introduction to Node Packages"` to commit your changes.

2. **Push to Your Fork**:
   - Run `git push` to push your commits to your forked repository on GitHub.

3. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
   - Click on 'Pull Request' to create a new pull request to the original repository.
   - Ensure the pull request details are filled out, explaining the changes you made.
